{- For the sake of clarity and to make the program easier to read, 2^Î» is split into four parts.
 - Main.hs contains just the main function that is called.
 - Game.hs contains all of the logic behind the code including:
        - New data types and game states
        - The render function
        - The input handler
 - Window.hs contains all the code relating to the window for the game.
        *You may want to change the resolution*
 - Visuals.hs contains all the Picture types, and relates to the visual elements of the game.

{- Main entry point to program.
